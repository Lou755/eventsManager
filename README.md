# Events Manager

This is a simple events management application built with Flask for the backend and a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. 
It allows users to view, add, edit, and delete events. The backend API runs on an AWS EC2 instance, 
and the frontend can be hosted on an S3 bucket.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account** (Amazon Web Services)
- **AWS EC2 instance** with a public IP address
- **AWS S3 bucket** for static file hosting
- **AWS DynamioDB** for storing
- **AWS Cloud 9** for an optional integrated development environment
- Basic knowledge of Github, basic AWS services, Flask, HTML, and JavaScript
